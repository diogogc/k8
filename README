-----------------------

My working setup:-

 - Softrock RXTX Ensemble
 - Behringer UCA222 USB Audio
 - libusb v1.0.19
 - fftw v3.3.4

This (so far) is a simple spectrum analyzer for OS X, that currently supports Softrock SDR hardware.

There is no binary install yet - you will need to download the entire Xcode project and build it.

TODO:-

 - Lots, so please get involved :-)
 - Binary install
 - Options menu
 - FFT zoom
 - Waterfall
 - Demodulation
 - Other hardware
